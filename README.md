# PHONE SALES DATA ANALYSIS

In the analysis, I sought to answer the following questions:

**Questions**
1. Which phone models have the highest sales volume?
2. How do average selling prices vary across different phone brands?
3. Does a phone's color affect its pricing?
4. What are the top-rated mobile models?
5. Does a Higher Discount Lead to Higher Sales?
